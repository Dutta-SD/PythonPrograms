About Bucket Sort
---------------------------------------------------------------
>   Bucket Sort is a non comparison based algorithm. That is 
    it does not compare between elements for Sorting. So we should
    know or have some assumptions about the array to be sorted.

>   Bucket Sort first places each element into a specific bucket.
    We can think of a bucket as a container which contains some similar
    elements based on a property.                                         

Eg : If we have an array [1, 3, 3, 8, 5] and our bucket condition is:
    " <= 3", then we will have the following buckets.

    Bucket 1 (element <= 3) : [1, 3, 3]
    Bucket 2 (element > 3) : [8, 5]

>   After placing into buckets, we will sort the buckets individually.
    (Generally insertion sort is used in this step)
>   Then we merge the buckets one by one, starting from the bucket with
    the smallest values.
